# About
This project was done in collaboration with a colleague. It was about teaching us how to use object oriented programming. The project was about implementing an electronics shop and its sale-order system. The second assignment required us to create a class to read the products in the shop from a txt file. 


Bellow is the class diagram of the project which can also be found [here](https://github.com/abki12c/AUEB-projects/blob/main/2nd%20semester/Java%20Programming/MY_CLASS_DIAGRAM.jpg)
