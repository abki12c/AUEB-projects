# About
Here are my university projects over the years. This repository is used for me to keep track of my university projects. Every project belongs to a semester the corresponding subject belongs to.

Note that some projects are done in collaboration with some colleagues and in every project it's stated whether it was a personal project or collaborative (and if it's collaborative it may be stated what i helped with in the project)
