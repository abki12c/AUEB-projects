# About
This project was about creating a website. Me and my colleague decided to make a website about a company that rents rooms for things like exhibitions, public speaches etc.

I was responsible for the contact us and More Info Page (rooms.html , third.html and the according css files)

The project instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/abki12c/AUEB-projects/blob/main/1st%20semester/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Science/website%20project/HTML_project-2019-2020.pdf)
